# Fast Feet

Implementation of the example in chapter 4 of Sandi Metz's Practical object oriented design in Ruby.

Use case:
```
As a customer, in order to choose a trip, I would like to see a list of available trips of
appropriate difficulty, on a specific date, where rental bicycles are available. 
```
